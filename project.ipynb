Per report his wife did not witness the \\nevent but was at his side immediately after and stated his eyes \\nwere open but he was unable to speak and vomited x 1.  He \\nsustained AC joint separation and was initially admitted to \\northo trauma service. He also had head CT that showed L temporal \\nbone fracture and neurosurgery was consulted. Neurology was \\nconsulted for ? seizure activity and altered mental status.\\n.\\nWhen I meet patient on floor, he is unable to confirm above \\nhistory.

He denies pain but when he \\nmoves for physical exam, he screams out in pain and does not \\nknow why his shoulder hurts. When I tell him that he fell and \\nseparated his shoulder, he denies prior knowledge of fall or \\nshoulder separation. \\n.\\nHe denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain currently. no fevers \\nor chills, no dysuria, chest pain, shortness of breath. His last \\ndose of Percocet was @1500 today, he received 8 tabs of Percocet \\nin last 24 hours.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n\\n___ yo male with hx of seizure d/o and congenital hydrocephalus \\nadmitted after unwitnessed mechanical fall at home. He was \\nadmitted to trauma service and found to have a grade 3 left \\nshoulder separation as well as temporal bone fracture. \\nNeurosurgery was consulted for the temporal bone fracture and \\nstated that no surgical intervention was necessary. There was no \\nevidence of intracranial bleed. Regarding the shoulder \\nseparation, conservative management was recommended and the arm \\nwas placed in a sling with activity restrictions of non-weight \\nbearing but early range of motion. He was treated with dilaudid \\nand percocet for pain management. \\n.\\nOn hospital day #2, patient was noted to be more confused and \\nsomnolent. Neurology had been consulted to evaluate etiology of \\nfall and whether it could have been related to his known seizure \\ndisorder or his gait disturbances. During neurology evaluation, \\nconsultants noted that patient was encephalopathic which \\nrepresented a significant change in his mental status from \\nbaseline as he is a high fucntioning ___ normally. patient \\nand patient's wife admitted to recent daily alcohol use although \\nhe was not felt to be actively withdrawing. It was felt that \\nconfusion was likely not related to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome \\nbut he was started on IV then PO thiamine repletion given the \\nhistory of alcohol use. He also had MRI of head which showed \\nstable ventriculomegaly and no other acute changes that could \\nexplain change in mental status. EEG was also done and report is \\npending at time of discharge. Neurology recommended transfer to \\nmedicine for further evaluation of mental status changes.\\n.\\nOn transfer to medicine service, patient was somnolent with \\ndecreased attention and severe retrograde and anterograde \\namnesia. All narcotics were stopped and mental status improved \\nwithin 24 hours. It was felt that narcotics were the main \\ncontributing factor to encephalopathy and narcotics should be \\navoided in the future as he has developed severe confusion in \\nthe past with narcotics. There also may be a component of \\ntemporal lobe contusion although this is difficult to assess \\nbecause of congenital hydrocephalus and baseline abnormalities \\nin head imaging. There was no evidence of infection or \\nnutritional deficiency that would explain confusion.\\n.\\nThroughout hospital course, patient also noted to be severely \\ndepressed with decreased interest, difficulty sleeping and some \\npassive suicidal ideation. He was assessed by pschyiatry who \\nfeel that he is not actively suicidal at this time but has \\nincreased depressive symptoms in setting of recent death of his \\nfather as well as decreased executive functioning. He should \\nfollow up with psychiatry as outpatient\\nbut has no acute inpatient psyhciatry needs at this time.\\n.\\nRegarding the fall, it is difficult to determine etiology \\nbecause of patient's amnesia of the event. His wife was by ___ \\nside immedidately afterwards and states his eyes were open \\ntherefore it does not appear to be related to syncope. Also \\nunlikely that this was a seizure although he has history of \\nseizure disorder for which he is on lamictal. He has been having \\nworsening gait instability over the past several years for \\nunclear reasons. He was noted to have peripheral neuropathy that \\nhas not been adequately worked up as an outpatient - unclear if \\nthis is related to alcohol use, vitamin deficiency vs other. He \\nwill follow up with neurology as an outpatient for further \\ntesting and work-up of this. He is also being discharged to \\nrehab for gait training given the gait instability. \\n.\\nLastly, he was noted to have microcytic anemia on admission. \\nIron studies revealed severe iron deficiency with iron of 16 and \\nferritin of 19.

EMS brought her to OSH where she has left \\neyelid twitching, left gaze preference and got ativan x1. CT \\nshowed a left occipital bleed.\\n\\nNEURO: Patient was transfered to ___ Neuro ICU. She had an MRI \\nwhich showed, in addition to bleed, a small DVA adjacent to \\nbleed which increases probability of cause of bleed bring \\ncavernous malformation. Her CTA showed otherwise normal vessels. \\nStroke work up revealed A1c 5.1, LDL 100. Due to concern for \\nvascular malformation of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, \\nangiogram was performed and was negative. She should have a \\nrepeat MRI 1 month after hematoma has resolved, and possibly \\nanother angiogram based on those results. Due to concern for \\nseizure the patient was started on Keppra. This was transitioned \\nto trileptal after discoverning that the patient had recently \\nbeen depressed. The patient became dizzy and diaphoretic after \\ninitiation of Trileptal to she remained on only Keppra and \\nwarned to talk to her doctor if he psychiatric symptoms \\nworsened. She had an EEG which preliminarily showed generalized \\nslowing. Formal read to follow.\\n\\nWhile patient initially had done well with ___ and OT, on ___ \\nshe became vertiginous, diaphoretic and anxious. We initially \\nthought this was due to Trileptal but even after stopping this \\nshe continued to have this reaction upon sitting up in bed on \\n___. Her orthostatics were negative and she did not have \\nnystagmus during the vertigo. For several minutes she appeared \\nvery anxious, said her husband's name was ___ and that she \\nlived at \"___\". She also developed some varying tremors. \\nThis may still have been due to trileptal as well as a \\npsychiatric element to her symptoms. We have therefore restarted \\nher Cymbalta and Effexor (had been held in ICU then patient \\ndeclined to restart because she was feeling well). \\n\\nID: The patient had leukocytosis on presentation and blood \\ncultures were positive from ___ with gram pos cocci so she was \\nstarted on vancomycin. Subsequent blood cultures were negative \\nso vancomycin was stopped after 3 days. Urinalysis was also \\npositive and culture grew Klebsiella so she was started on \\nceftriaxone. This was switched to bactrim on discharge.\\n\\nCARDS: The patient had a troponin elevation to 1.39 on \\npresentation. EKG showed no acute ST or T changes. Echo showed \\nhypokinesis of the inferior wall and apex. She was started on \\nmetoprolol for presumed CAD on the recommendation of cardiology. \\nTroponin trended down to 1.13. \\n\\nRESP: The patient arrived intubated. She was extubated on the \\nevening of ___. While in the ICU the patient had stridor and was \\nplaced on BiPAP then face mask overnight.\\n\\nTOX/METAB: The patient had mildly elevated LFTs and Utox \\npositive for methadone, barbiturates, cannabinoids at ___. \\nRepeat here was positive for benzos and barbiturates. Patient \\ndenied substance abuse.\\n\\nTRANSITION OF CARE:\\nFULL code\\nEnd bactrim in the evening ___\\nTitrate up psych meds as needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
